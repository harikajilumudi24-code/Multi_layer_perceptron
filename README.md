# Multi_layer_perceptron
This project predicts ovarian cancer diagnosis using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Clinical, biomarker, and patient history features such as age, tumor size, CA-125 and HE4 levels are preprocessed, encoded, and scaled to train an MLP model that learns complex non-linear patterns for accurate classification.
